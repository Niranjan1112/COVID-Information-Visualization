# COVID-Information-Visualization

This project is aimed at analysing the spread of coronavirus and the impact of coronavirus on Indian economy. This project describes the factors, effects and the consequences of coronavirus in India. We have designed graphs (bar chart, line chart, pie chart) in order to compare which states have been affected a lot due to coronavirus. And also, for the project to be interactive we have built dashboards which will be convenient for the user to select. These dashboards and graphs will show you many attributes like increase in daily cases, deceased, active and recovered cases among states in India. Most importantly, the consequences of coronavirus (unemployment, capital income, poverty) will also be covered in this project. Letâ€™s go ahead into the project!
